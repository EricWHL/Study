|  tmpnam  |
------------

The tmpnam function returns a valid filename that isn’t the same as any existing file.
If the string s isn’t null , the filename will also be written to it.
Further calls to tmpnam will overwrite the static storage used for return values, so it’s essential to use a string parameter if tmpnam is to be called many times.
The string is assumed to be at least L_tmpnam characters long.
tmpnam can be called up to TMP_MAX times in a single program, and it will generate a different filename each time.
If the temporary file is to be used immediately, you can name it and open it at the same time using the
tmpfile function.
This is important because another program could create a file with the same name as that returned by tmpnam .
The tmpfile function avoids this problem altogether

#include <stdio.h>

char *tmpnam(char *s);


------------
|  tmpfile |
------------

The tmpfile function returns a stream pointer that refers to a unique temporary file.
The file is opened for reading and writing (via fopen with w+ ), and it will be automatically deleted when all references to the file are closed.

#include <stdio.h>

FILE *tmpfile(void);
