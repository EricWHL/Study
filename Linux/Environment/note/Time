|  time  |
----------

You can find the low-level time value by calling the time function, which returns the number of seconds since the start of the epoch.
It will also write the returned value to a location pointed to by tloc , if this isnâ€™t a null pointer.

#include <time.h>

time_t time(time_t *tloc);

The difftime function calculates the difference between two time values and returns the value time1-time2 as a floating-point number.
For Linux, the return value from time is a number of seconds and can be manipulated, but for the ultimate in portability you should use difftime .
To present the time and date in a more meaningful way (to humans), we need to convert the time value into a recognizable time and date. There are standard functions to help with this.

#include <time.h>

double difftime(time_t time1, time_t time2);
